# comment-cleaner-c
C-program that cleans comments from a file, developed for a course "Sovellusohjelmointi" at Aalto University (Fall 2016).

This program cleans C-code comments away (lines that begin with "//" and blocks beginning with "/*" and ending with "*/"). Uses child processes, so you can clean multiple files at once. Works at least on Unix-systems.
